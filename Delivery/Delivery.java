package Delivery;

/* you have to design Customer, Product. 
Customer contains Address...etc. It requires to be scalable such that zipcodes are not fixed/given
(you do not have like a list of zipcodes which is all products' shipping range), 
you have to write a function to check if customer's zipcode is vaild and within product shipping range. 
So if we want to update product's shipping range, we do not need to edit anything.
Basically it is like a Delivery app design. */
